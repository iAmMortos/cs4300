In 1969, during the Apollo 12 mission, a tiny piece of art was secretly smuggled onto the Moon. Known as the Moon Museum, it was a small ceramic wafer featuring miniature sketches from six prominent artists, including Andy Warhol and Robert Rauschenberg. The artwork was covertly attached to the lunar lander’s leg by a NASA engineer without official approval. If true, it means the first art gallery on the Moon was an unsanctioned act of creative rebellion—one that still sits on the lunar surface today.
