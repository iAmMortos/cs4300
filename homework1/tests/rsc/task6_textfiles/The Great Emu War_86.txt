In 1932, Australia found itself at war with... emus. After World War I, struggling farmers in Western Australia were overrun by tens of thousands of the flightless birds, which ravaged crops. The government responded by deploying soldiers armed with machine guns. The emus, however, proved unexpectedly resilient: outrunning vehicles, scattering under fire, and absorbing bullets like feathery tanks. After weeks of fruitless battle, the humans admitted defeat. The emus had won. To this day, the Great Emu War remains one of historyâ€™s most bizarre military failures.
